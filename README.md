# BMI-Calc

This is a short project where to get experience with panda as well as reading and modifying from csv files.

## How to use

1. Make sure you have Python 3 and the Pandas library installed (`pip install pandas`).
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python script (e.g., **BMI.py**).
3. Save the CSV file **sampledata.csv** in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Run the Python script, and it will prompt you to enter the name of the CSV file.
5. After entering the filename, the script will calculate BMI and weight status for each row in the CSV file and save the updated data back to the same file.
